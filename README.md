# ActivityTracker

Before proceeding please note that the app is not yet finished! This is my latest project but due to my constant engagement in another company I didn’t yet have time to fully work on it. But still, it is definitely worth having a look.

To see the App in action: https://secret-sierra-87653.herokuapp.com/

This is a MERN stack app which I started making in order to practice the connection between backend and frontend, as well as to get familiar with production and development environments. 

It uses the latest features of React, such as React Hooks, Redux, react-router, etc.. and it combines with node.js and MongoDB as the backend services with passport as an O-Auth solution that uses cookies. All is connected with proxy so that it redirects incoming requests from the frontend to the backend.   

Even though the project is not yet finished, it has some features already when logged in, take a look at the ToDos, by creating tasks you can se the server recognizes the date of them, you can complete them or delete them and so on… Also the ToBuys are constructed. 

The whole idea of the app is to make 1 place where a user can keep track of many sorts of activities that he plans to do, for example leave links of movies he wants to watch, make Travel plans and compare prices, things he wants to buy and in the end show a money graph which displays user expenses. 

In the end we all know how many times a week we say oh I want to do this, buy that, go there, watch that but it seems that we always forget half of it. This App is a good solution to that problem, just write it down, it takes 30 seconds, and when the time comes, open it and enjoy your ideas 
